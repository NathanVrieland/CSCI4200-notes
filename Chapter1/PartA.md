# Reasons for studying Programming languages 

## increased ability to express Ideas
 
## improved backround for choosing appropriate languages 

## increased ability to learn new languages 

## better understanding of the significance of implimentation 
- to use language more intelignetly 
- understand choices among language constructs and their concequences 
- better visualize computer execution 

## better use of languages already known 
- learn previously unknown parts of languages 

## overall advancment of computing 
- the more informed, the better choices we make in selecting a language 

# programming domains
## scientific 
- large numbers float types and arrays
- Fortran

## Buisiness 
- produce reports, use of decimal numbers and chars
- COBOl

## AI
- symbols rather than numbers, linked lists 
- LISP

## Systems 
- efficiency 
- C

## Web software
- collection of langages 
- HTML, PHP, JAVA

# language evaluation 

- listing language criteria is controverisal 
- most agree that criteria are important 

## readability 
- must be considered in the context of the problem domain 
- Python is easy to read for data scientists beacuse of its flexable math syntax
- COBOL is readable for buisness people because they eat crayons

## writability 
- ease with wich a language can be used 
- contex is also important 
- `count++;` is more writable than `count = count + 1;`

## reliability 
- able to develop crash proof code 
- if it preforms to its specifications under all conditions 
- strongly typed = reliable
